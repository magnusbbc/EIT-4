# EIT-4 BEN Processor
This repository contains the files required to synthesize the BEN CPU onto a TERASIC DE0 (Cyclone III). All the VHDL design files are stored in the "VHDL" folder. A simple assembler for the BEN CPU's instruction set is also made available, source files can be found under "Assembler". PSoC code (for the Cypress LP5) for sampling and sending data to the FPGA/CPU is found under "PSoC". PCB/3D Print/laser engraving files are found in "Fabrication". Finally, documentation for the project is contained in the documentation folder

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your own hardware for development and testing purposes.
